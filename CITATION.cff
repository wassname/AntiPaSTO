abstract: >-
  As models grow more capable, humans cannot reliably verify what they say.
  Scalable steering requires methods that are internal, self-supervised, and
  transfer out-of-distribution; existing methods satisfy some but not all three.
  We introduce AntiPaSTO, which separates representations along an antiparallel
  axis (+1/-1 produce opposite shifts), with coherence constraints preventing
  collapse. Human input is minimal: two contrasting words inserted into template
  sentences, no preference labels.
